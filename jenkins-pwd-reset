Disable Jenkins Security
Log onto your Jenkins server using an account with root privileges. Once logged in, look open Jenkin’s configration XML file into a text editor.

In the example below, we are opening the file in teminal.

sudo vi /var/lib/jenkins/config.xml
With the configuration file opened, perform a search for the useSecurity string. This can be done in VIM by pressing ESC and then entering /useSecurity.

The line you are looking for should resemble the following.
<useSecurity>true</useSecurity>
Press i to enter VIM’s insert mode. Modify the value between the <useSecurity> tags and set the value to false.

<useSecurity>false</useSecurity>
Save your changes and then exit the text editor. If you are using VIM, press ESC and then enter wq! to write your changes and then exit the editor.
Your changes will not take affect until Jenkins is restarted. Restart the service now.

sudo systemctl restart jenkins
